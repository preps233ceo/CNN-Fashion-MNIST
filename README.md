# Fashion MNIST Classification using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The implementation is done using Keras and TensorFlow.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras (part of TensorFlow)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Instructions

1. **Install the required libraries(Run in the terminal):**  
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

3. **Run the code:**
The code is provided in `Fashion MNIST Classification.ipynb`. Execute this file to train the CNN model and make predictions.


3. **Predictions:**
The script will display the actual and predicted labels for two sample images from the test set.

## Files

- `Fashion MNIST Classification.ipynb`: The main script for loading data, training the model, and making predictions.
- `README.md`: Instructions for running the code.
